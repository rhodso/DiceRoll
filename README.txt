Hello!
This is my first time using github so apologies if it all goes wrong.

This is my DiceRoll bot for discord. It *should* be woking fine.

**IMPORTANT**
In order for the bot to work, you need to add your bot token to the file "Token.txt"
If that file doesn't exist, create it

Usage:

|rtd [NumberOfDice] [SidesOfDice]

So to roll 3 6-sided dice, execute:
|rtd 3 6

If you want to set this up for your server, then go read the wiki!
Feel free to leave feedback!
