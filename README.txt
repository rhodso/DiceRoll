Hello!
This is my first time using github so apologies if it all goes wrong.

This is my DiceRoll bot for discord. It *should* be woking fine.

Usage:

|rtd [NumberOfDice] [SidesOfDice] [Modifier]

So to roll 3 6-sided dice with a modifier of +3 execute:
|rtd 3 6 +3

If you want to set this up for your server, then go read the wiki!
