This is my DiceRoll bot for discord. It *should* be woking fine.

**IMPORTANT**
In order for the bot to work, you need to add your bot token to the file "token.txt"
You will need to create this file in the root directory

Usage:

|rtd [NumberOfDice] [SidesOfDice] [Modifier]

So to roll 3 6-sided dice with a modifier of +3 execute:
|rtd 3 6 +3

If you want to set this up for your server, then go read the wiki!
